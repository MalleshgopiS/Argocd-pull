title: ArgoCD Pulls Git LFS Pointer Files Instead of Binary Content

category: CI/CD Pipeline
difficulty: medium
horizon: short
environment: kubernetes

description: |
  The Bleater frontend application is failing after an ArgoCD sync.

  The application depends on a WebAssembly artifact (app.wasm)
  stored in Git using Git LFS.

  ArgoCD successfully synchronizes the repository, but instead of
  downloading the binary artifact, it deploys a Git LFS pointer file.

  Because of this:
  - Frontend pods crash
  - Deployment never becomes Ready
  - Service endpoints remain empty

  Your task is to diagnose and fix the ArgoCD configuration
  so Git LFS objects are properly fetched.

  You MUST patch existing resources.
  You MUST NOT delete or recreate the frontend deployment.

success_criteria:
  - WASM file no longer contains Git LFS pointer metadata
  - Deployment becomes Ready
  - Deployment UID preserved
  - Git LFS enabled in repo-server
  - Service endpoints restored
